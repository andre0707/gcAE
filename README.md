## Description

gcAE is a small geocaching related Safari extension to open listing coordinates and waypoints of the opened geocaching website in maps. This allows you to easy navigate to the geocache without downloading it.

You can also easy copy the GC-code, GC-link and coordinates to clipboard to paste it for example in a messanger app.
The App will send you notifications about success or error to copy GC-code/GC-link to clipboard.

Use gcAE to add geocaching events (or geocaches) to your iOS calendar (therefore you have to click on the notification).

There is also an option to share the GC-link in the standard share menu.

The shown geocache can als be opened in a third party geocaching app. It can't be directly opened, but there are two options.
A) You get a notification, by clicking on it you will be redirected to the third party geocaching app.
B) A link to open the third party geocaching app will be included on the current website, behind the geocache name.

Third party navigation apps are also available via notification.

Caution: Coordinates on geocaching.com are only visible if you have an account there.
