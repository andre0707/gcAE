## Description

gcAE is a small helper tool for interacting with geocaching websites. 
It all started with an action extension to easily perform some actions on geocaching websites.
New with gcAE 4.0 a real iOS 15 Safari extension is included. This way the actions are even faster reachable.

Use the main app to configure the actions you want to see on geocaching websites.
The following are available:
- Copy gc code to clipboard
- Copy gc link to clipboard
- Copy personal notes to clipboard
- Copy gc link and personal notes to clipboard
- Copy listing coordinates to clipboard
- Create a calendar entry (requires to send a local notification which you have to click)
- Open geocache in one of your installed geocaching apps like Cachly
- Open the coordinates in one of your installed navigation apps

There is a variation of geocaching and navigation apps supported. The main app will list the ones you have installed.

The previous action extension is still available and covers all the actions the new Safari extension does.

With the action extension you can also pass the gc code from publish emails to your geocaching app.
Just long press the link in the email, select share and gcAE. You then have the option to open the gc code in your geocaching app
